Start the page with a DoFixture

!|MMLearnFit.MyFirstDoFixture|

Tables call methods of the DoFixture - simple name, no args.

!|myFirstMethod|

Table rows call methods of the DoFixture - complex names (even cells), odd cells are args to the methods.

!|myFirst|1234|Funny Name Method|abcd|
|myFirst|5678|Funny Name Method|defg|

Methods that return fit.Fixture or subtypes create/execute other fixtures - in this case the method returns a OsCommandLineFixture object (based on Uncle Bob's command line fixture).
The subsequent rows of the table are handled by this fixture object.

|myFixtureSpawningMethod|
|command|cmd /c dir c:\|0|

Methods that are not part of the DoFixture or the object delegated as the System Under Test are other fixtures that are created before control returns to the DoFixture.

!|SomeOtherFixture|abc|def|123|
